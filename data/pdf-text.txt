The patient is a 49 yo perimenopausal F seen in consultation for newly diagnosed right breast cancer.
She underwent bilateral screening mammogram in July of 2023 and further diagnostic imaging was
recommended of the right breast due to an area of focal asymmetry. She denies any breast symptoms at
the time including palpable masses, breast pain, nipple discharge, skin changes. She underwent
diagnostic imaging which revealed a hypoechoic mass approximately 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.7 cm at the 7 o'clock
position and a 1 cm benign-appearing cyst at the 9 o'clock position. Biopsy of the 7:00 mass was
recommended and completed which revealed benign breast tissue. Follow up imaging was completed in
6 months and at that time the mass had increased in size, 1.4 x 0.7 x 1.2cm and biopsy was again
recommended, in addition a lymph node with mild cortical thickening was also recommended for biopsy.
Biopsy of the breast mass at this time revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1, ER positive PR
positive and HER2 negative. At time of biopsy there were no enlarged or suspicious axillary lymph nodes,
so no lymph node biopsy was completed.
She has been seen in surgical consultation with Dr.
and plans on bilateral mastectomies and
sentinel node biopsy on the right. Surgery is scheduled for next month. She is here today accompanied
by her significant other.

Bilateral mammogram 7/14/23
BREAST COMPOSITION:
The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense, this may lower the sensitivity of
mammography.
FINDINGS:
Right breast: There is a focal asymmetry in the posterior lower outer quadrant at
7:00 to 8:00 position (CC 22 and MLO 23).
Left breast: There is no suspicious mass, architectural distortion or calcifications
to suggest malignancy. There is no significant change in comparison to the prior
mammogram(s).

AMMOGRAM
DOB: 09/10/1974 Encounter Date: 03/27/2024
TECHNIQUE: Right 2-D and 3-D tomosynthesis images were obtained. Computer aided
detection (CAD) was used to assist in the interpretation.
BREAST COMPOSITION:
The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense, this may lower the sensitivity of
mammography.
FINDINGS:
Mass in the posterior lateral breast with indistinct/irregular margins is again seen
on spot CC 27, likely correlated on spot MLO 20 in the lower outer quadrant.
ULTRASOUND
TECHNIQUE: Real-time grayscale and color images were obtained and are reviewed. This
study is limited to the region of interest.
FINDINGS: In the 7:00 position 5 cm from the nipple there is a hypoechoic mass with
irregular margins measuring 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.7 cm without internal flow on Doppler. This
is corresponds to the mammographic finding and is suspicious.
In the 9:00 position 6 cm from the nipple a benign-appearing 7 x 5 x 10 mm cyst is
seen.
No abnormal axillary lymph nodes are identified.
ASSESSMENT:
BI-RADS CATEGORY (4) suspicious. Biopsy should be considered.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Right Ultrasound-guided breast biopsy for mass in the 7:00 position 5 cm from the
nipple
MA-MAMMO DIAGNOSTIC 3D TOMO RT
DATE OF SERVICE: 8/10/2023 3:58 PM
INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION: R92.8: Other abnormal and inconclusive findings
on diagnostic imaging of breast. Scheduled stereotactic biopsy of a
previously identified asymmetry within the right breast.
HISTORY: This is a 48 years-old Female with no reported family history of
breast cancer.
COMPARISONS: 7/28/2023 through 5/27/2022
TECHNIQUE: 2-D and 3-D tomosynthesis images of the right breast were
obtained in the CC, ML, and MLO projections in attempts to identify the
previous mammographic mass of concern.
Computer aided detection (CAD) was used to assist in the interpretation of
the 2D mammogram.

BREAST COMPOSITION:
DOB: 09/10/1974 Encounter Date: 03/27/2024
The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense, this may lower the sensitivity
of mammography.
FINDINGS:
There are no masses, architectural distortions, or calcifications to suggest
malignancy.
The previously described irregular mass could not be reproduced on today's
targeting images. This may be secondary to the far posterior location of the
finding. Multiple attempts were made for full inclusion of the breast in
both CC, ML and MLO projections.
In the absence of a discrete target, the scheduled procedure was canceled.
Plan for mammographic follow-up in 6 months. This was reviewed with the
patient at the end of the examination.
ASSESSMENT:
BI-RADS CATEGORY (3) Probably Benign.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Right Follow-up diagnostic 3D mammogram (Tomosynthesis) in 6 months
Right Diagnostic breast ultrasound if needed
DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM R/US 2/16/24
TECHNIQUE: 2-D and 3-D tomosynthesis images were obtained of the right breast.
Computer aided detection (CAD) was used to assist in the interpretation of the 2D
mammogram.
BREAST COMPOSITION:
The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense, this may lower the sensitivity of
mammography.
FINDINGS:
Butterfly clip is noted in the 6:00 breast. There is a proximally 1.5 cm x 1.3 cm
focal asymmetry in the posterior third of the lower outer quadrant as seen on CC 25,
MLO 27. On the spot tomographic CC image 22, there is a persistent 1 cm x 0.8 cm
asymmetry with question of architectural distortion, possibly associated
calcification. However, this is not definitely seen on the MLO spot tomo view..
LIMITED RIGHT BREAST ULTRASOUND: Multiple, sonographic images were obtained of the
right breast in the area of mammographic interest. At 8:00 8 cm from the nipple there
is a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with indistinct margins which measures 1.4 cm x
0.7 cm x 1.2 cm. Internal flow is demonstrated, and ultrasound-guided biopsy is
recommended. This likely corresponds to the mammographic area of interest. Recommend
clip correlation. If not, further evaluation with reattempted and stereo biopsy or
MRI is recommended.
There is a lymph node with mild cortical thickening measuring 0.4 cm. Recommend
ultrasound-guided biopsy.
ASSESSMENT:
BI-RADS CATEGORY (4) suspicious. Biopsy should be considered.

IMPRESSION:
1. Enhancing mass measuring up to 2 cm in the lower outer right breast at posterior
depth compatible with known malignancy. Biopsy clip in appropriate position.
Continued surgical management.
2. 1.1 cm of linear non mass enhancement in the upper central right breast. MRI
guided biopsy is recommended particularly in the setting of known malignancy.
3. Prominent low right conglomerate axillary nodes, level 1. This was not
appreciated on the day of the biopsy on February 23rd however sentinel lymph node
sampling can be performed as clinically indicated. Please see image 51 of series 100.
4. No abnormal findings are seen within the left breast or axilla.
Applicable pathology and laboratory studies were reviewed and discussed with the patient.

MD on 2/27/2024 at 1045
NOTE
Microscopic slides were examined.
Properly controlled immunohistochemical stains for smooth muscle myosin and p63
were performed and shows loss of basal myoepithelial staining associated with invasive
tumor. Areas of DCIS show preserved basal myoepithelial staining. E-cadherin and
p120 show strong membranous positivity, consistent with a ductal phenotype.
BREAST CANCER BIOMARKER RESULTS
(Invasive)
Estrogen Receptor (ER): Positive (greater than 90% nuclear positivity with
strong staining intensity)
Progesterone Receptor (PR): Positive (greater than 90% nuclear positivity with
strong staining intensity)
Ki-67: Approximately 10-20%
HER-2 by IHC: Negative (score 1+)
HER-2 by FISH: Pending.
Cold ischemia and fixation times meet requirements specified in the latest version of
ASCO/CAP guidelines, unless otherwise specified. Estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor (PR) and HER-2 IHC studies are performed on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue by immunohistochemistry, using antibody clone SP1 for ER,
1E2 for PR and 4B5 for HER-2 IHC by an FDA-cleared vendor (Ventana). Detection is
by a biotin-free, multimer-based system. The intensity of staining is graded as weak,
moderate or strong, and percent of positive tumor nuclei is estimated. Estrogen and
progesterone receptor status are interpreted as positive (at least weak staining in 1% of
tumor nuclei) or negative (<1% of tumor nuclei). HER2 IHC is graded as negative (0
and 1+ staining), equivocal (2+ staining) and positive (3+ staining). This assay has not
been validated on decalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution given
the likelihood of false negativity on decalcified specimens.

1. Invasive ductal carcinoma, right breast. Peri/post-menopausal female.
G1, ER+/PR+ and her2 negative, ki 67 10-20%.
Clinically T1cN0, stage IA.
She is planning on bilateral mastectomies and sentinel node biopsy on right.
Reviewed with patient her pathology in detail. Low grade IDC, strongly HR positive with low ki67 all
prognostically favorable. Given clinical size, recommend oncotype dx testing post-operatively to guide
decision making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy.
I do recommend adjuvant endocrine therapy adjuvantly. Per gynecology last note appears early
menopause. Reasonable to start with tamoxifen and then transition to once post-menopausal. Decision
will ultimately also depend on results of oncotype dx testing, other consideration is ovarian suppression
and Al.
I will see her back post-operatively to review Oncotype DX results and formalized adjuvant therapy plan.
All of her questions were addressed.
2. Additional 1.1cm linear non mass enhancement area on right breast MRI. Order placed for additional
biopsy. As patient is planning on mastectomy, I am not sure this is necessary but will defer to surgeon.

Last bilateral screening mammogram was in 7/14/2023. At that time there was a focal asymmetry noted
in the posterior lower outer quadrant of the right breast. There were no concerning findings on the left.
Right breast additional views and ultrasound were performed on 7/21/2023. Mass persisted on spot
compression. Ultrasound at the 7 o'clock position 5 cm from the nipple showed a hypoechoic mass with
irregular margins measuring 1.2 x 0.3 × 0.7 cm. There is no evidence of axillary adenopathy. Ultrasound-
guided right breast biopsy was performed on 7/28/2023. Pathology showed benign breast tissue.
Pathology was was not performed. When patient presented for biopsy, the mass could not be
reproduced. She then underwent repeat right breast diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on
2/16/2024. Mammogram showed the butterfly clip. There is a 1.5 x 1.3 cm focal asymmetry in the
posterior third of the lower outer quadrant of the right breast. Ultrasound at the 8 o'clock position 8 cm
from the nipple showed a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with indistinct margins measuring 1.4 x 0.7 x
1.2 cm. There was a lymph node with mild cortical thickening measuring up to 4 mm. Biopsy was

Microscopic slides were examined.
Properly controlled immunohistochemical stains for smooth muscle myosin and p63 were performed and shows
loss of basal myoepithelial staining associated with invasive tumor. Areas of DCIS show preserved basal
myoepithelial staining. E-cadherin and p120 show strong membranous positivity, consistent with a ductal
phenotype.

(Invasive)
DOB: 09/10/1974 Encounter Date: 03/12/2024
Estrogen Receptor (ER): Positive (greater than 90% nuclear positivity with strong staining intensity)
Progesterone Receptor (PR): Positive (greater than 90% nuclear positivity with strong staining intensity)
Ki-67: Approximately 10-20%
HER-2 by IHC: Negative (score 1+)
HER-2 by FISH: Pending.
Cold ischemia and fixation times meet requirements specified in the latest version of ASCO/CAP guidelines,
unless otherwise specified. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER-2 IHC studies are
performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by immunohistochemistry, using antibody clone SP1 for
ER, 1E2 for PR and 4B5 for HER-2 IHC by an FDA-cleared vendor (Ventana). Detection is by a biotin-free,
multimer-based system. The intensity of staining is graded as weak, moderate or strong, and percent of
positive tumor nuclei is estimated. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status are interpreted as positive (at
least weak staining in 1% of tumor nuclei) or negative (<1% of tumor nuclei). HER2 IHC is graded as negative
(0 and 1+ staining), equivocal (2+ staining) and positive (3+ staining). This assay has not been validated on
decalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution given the likelihood of false negativity on
decalcified specimens.

She has an appointment scheduled with medical oncology. I discussed her case directly with Dr.
We discussed the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma at length. We discussed the potential treatment
options of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Surgical options discussed were
lumpectomy to be followed by adjuvant radiation or mastectomy, both to include sentinel lymph node
mapping and biopsy and possible axillary lymph node dissection. We discussed the role of bilateral
mastectomy and plastic surgery reconstruction.
After considering her options, she is interested in bilateral simple mastectomy, right axillary sentinel lymph
node biopsy, possible right axillary lymph node dissection, and immediate reconstruction per plastic
surgery. Risks of surgery discussed include, but are not limited to, bleeding, infection, seroma,
numbness, scarring, injury to surrounding structures, need for additional procedures, poor cosmetic
outcome, lymphedema, or cardiopulmonary risks of anesthesia. She expressed understanding of these
risks and agrees to proceed with surgery.
Referral to plastic surgery has been placed.

Narrative & Impression
MRI-BREAST BIL W/WO CON
INDICATION: Recent diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma in the right breast.
Multiple priors.
TECHNIQUE: MRI-BREAST BIL W/WO CON. Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images were
obtained prior to and post intravenous injection of Clariscan. The color-flow
dynamics, maximum intensity projection and time intensity curves are reviewed. The
images were obtained using a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 Tesla or greater magnet.
FINDINGS:
There is mild background enhancement bilaterally.
BREAST COMPOSITION:
Scattered fibroglandular tissue.
RIGHT BREAST:
In the lower outer right breast at posterior depth there is an enhancing mass
measuring 2 x 0.7 x 1.5 cm (image 84 of series 200 and image 223 of series 7). Biopsy

clip is in appropriate position.
DOB: 09/10/1974
Linear nonmass enhancement measuring 1.1 cm seen on series 603 image 64 and series 7
image 192.
Prominent low level 1 axillary lymph node conglomerate on image 51, measuring about
1.3 cm in total. Cortical thickness difficult to measure.
LEFT BREAST:
No suspicious findings of left breast. Left axillary nodes within normal limits.
OTHER: No significant abnormality.
IMPRESSION:
1. Enhancing mass measuring up to 2 cm in the lower outer right breast at posterior
depth compatible with known malignancy. Biopsy clip in appropriate position.
Continued surgical management.
2. 1.1 cm of linear non mass enhancement in the upper central right breast. MRI
guided biopsy is recommended particularly in the setting of known malignancy.
3. Prominent low right conglomerate axillary nodes, level 1. This was not
appreciated on the day of the biopsy on February 23rd however sentinel lymph node
sampling can be performed as clinically indicated. Please see image 51 of series 100.
4. No abnormal findings are seen within the left breast or axilla.
ASSESSMENT:
BI-RADS CATEGORY (4) suspicious. Biopsy should be considered.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Right MRI guided breast biopsy

PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: R92.8: Other abnormal and inconclusive findings on diagnostic
imaging of breast
POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Same pending radiographic pathologic correlation
INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION: Mass
LESION LOCATION: Right breast at the 8:00 at 8 cm.
The procedure was explained to the patient including risk and possible complications.
Informed consent was obtained.
PROCEDURE: The procedure site was marked and a timeout procedure was performed. The
patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was provided
(lidocaine 1% without epinephrine). A 14-gauge coaxial spring-loaded core biopsy
needle was used. Under direct ultrasound guidance, the needle was guided into the
area of concern. Multiple core biopsies were obtained. A T3 coil biopsy clip was
placed at the site. The needles were removed. Hemostasis was achieved. The skin
was closed and dressed in usual fashion. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Home instructions were given.
Previous ultrasound study also indicated possible large lymph node in the axilla.
Prebiopsy repeat imaging through the axillary region failed to identify any cortical
thickening or hilar effacement. Axillary biopsy was not performed.
SPECIMEN:
Specimen was sent to pathology
POSTPROCEDURAL MAMMOGRAM: The postprocedural mammogram showed satisfactory clip
placement and postprocedural changes. Images were annotated. Comparison to previous
mammogram 2/16/2024 shows biopsy marker consistent with previous area identified in
the posterior third of the right breast.
CONCLUSION: Successful ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy procedure right breast.
ASSESSMENT:
Waiting for Pathology.

Good News! Your testing was reassuring but further imaging is needed to verify stability in the upcoming
months. We have sent those orders to radiology. If you have further concerns or changes please let us know.
Here is your schedule for testing:
Right Follow-up diagnostic 3D mammogram (Tomosynthesis) in 6 months
Right Diagnostic breast ultrasound if needed

INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION: N63.10: Unspecified lump in the right breast, unspecified
quadrant. Follow-up previously recommended.
DATE OF SERVICE: 2/16/2024 7:44 AM
COMPARISONS: December 11, 2020 through August to, 2023.
MAMMOGRAM
TECHNIQUE: 2-D and 3-D tomosynthesis images were obtained of the right breast.
Computer aided detection (CAD) was used to assist in the interpretation of the 2D
mammogram.
BREAST COMPOSITION:
The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense, this may lower the sensitivity of
mammography.
FINDINGS:
Butterfly clip is noted in the 6:00 breast. There is a proximally 1.5 cm x 1.3 cm
focal asymmetry in the posterior third of the lower outer quadrant as seen on CC 25,
MLO 27. On the spot tomographic CC image 22, there is a persistent 1 cm x 0.8 cm
asymmetry with question of architectural distortion, possibly associated
calcification. However, this is not definitely seen on the MLO spot tomo view..
LIMITED RIGHT BREAST ULTRASOUND: Multiple, sonographic images were obtained of the
right breast in the area of mammographic interest. At 8:00 8 cm from the nipple there
is a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with indistinct margins which measures 1.4 cm x
0.7 cm x 1.2 cm. Internal flow is demonstrated, and ultrasound-guided biopsy is
recommended. This likely corresponds to the mammographic area of interest. Recommend
clip correlation. If not, further evaluation with reattempted and stereo biopsy or

MRI is recommended.
DOB: 09/10/1974
There is a lymph node with mild cortical thickening measuring 0.4 cm. Recommend
ultrasound-guided biopsy.
ASSESSMENT:
BI-RADS CATEGORY (4) suspicious. Biopsy should be considered.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Right Ultrasound-guided breast biopsy 2 sites, at 8:00 and axilla.
ر
Right Stereotactic breast biopsy should be reattempted if the area of interest does
not correspond to the spot CC finding.
A result letter will be sent to the patient. Findings and recommendations were
