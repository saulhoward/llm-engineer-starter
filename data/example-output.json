She denies any breast symptoms at\nthe time including palpable masses, breast pain, nipple discharge, skin changes. She underwent\ndiagnostic imaging which revealed a hypoechoic mass approximately 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.7 cm at the 7 o'clock\nposition and a 1 cm benign-appearing cyst at the 9 o'clock position. Biopsy of the 7:00 mass was\nrecommended and completed which revealed benign breast tissue. Follow up imaging was completed in\n6 months and at that time the mass had increased in size, 1.4 x 0.7 x 1.2cm and biopsy was again\nrecommended, in addition a lymph node with mild cortical thickening was also recommended for biopsy.\nBiopsy of the breast mass at this time revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1, ER positive PR\npositive and HER2 negative. At time of biopsy there were no enlarged or suspicious axillary lymph nodes,\nso no lymph node biopsy was completed.\nShe has been seen in surgical consultation with Dr.\nand plans on bilateral mastectomies and\nsentinel node biopsy on the right. Surgery is scheduled for next month.

This may be secondary to the far posterior location of the\nfinding. Multiple attempts were made for full inclusion of the breast in\nboth CC, ML and MLO projections.\nIn the absence of a discrete target, the scheduled procedure was canceled.\nPlan for mammographic follow-up in 6 months.

There is a proximally 1.5 cm x 1.3 cm\nfocal asymmetry in the posterior third of the lower outer quadrant as seen on CC 25,\nMLO 27. On the spot tomographic CC image 22, there is a persistent 1 cm x 0.8 cm\nasymmetry with question of architectural distortion, possibly associated\ncalcification. However, this is not definitely seen on the MLO spot tomo view..\nLIMITED RIGHT BREAST ULTRASOUND: Multiple, sonographic images were obtained of the\nright breast in the area of mammographic interest. At 8:00 8 cm from the nipple there\nis a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with indistinct margins which measures 1.4 cm x\n0.7 cm x 1.2 cm. Internal flow is demonstrated, and ultrasound-guided biopsy is\nrecommended. This likely corresponds to the mammographic area of interest. Recommend\nclip correlation. If not, further evaluation with reattempted and stereo biopsy or\nMRI is recommended.\nThere is a lymph node with mild cortical thickening measuring 0.4 cm.

Detection is\nby a biotin-free, multimer-based system. The intensity of staining is graded as weak,\nmoderate or strong, and percent of positive tumor nuclei is estimated. Estrogen and\nprogesterone receptor status are interpreted as positive (at least weak staining in 1% of\ntumor nuclei) or negative (<1% of tumor nuclei). HER2 IHC is graded as negative (0\nand 1+ staining), equivocal (2+ staining) and positive (3+ staining). This assay has not\nbeen validated on decalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution given\nthe likelihood of false negativity on decalcified specimens.\nWolff, AC, Hammond ME, Hicks DG, et al.

At that time there was a focal asymmetry noted\nin the posterior lower outer quadrant of the right breast. There were no concerning findings on the left.\nRight breast additional views and ultrasound were performed on 7/21/2023. Mass persisted on spot\ncompression. Ultrasound at the 7 o'clock position 5 cm from the nipple showed a hypoechoic mass with\nirregular margins measuring 1.2 x 0.3 × 0.7 cm. There is no evidence of axillary adenopathy. Ultrasound-\nguided right breast biopsy was performed on 7/28/2023. Pathology showed benign breast tissue.\nPathology was was not performed. When patient presented for biopsy, the mass could not be\nreproduced. She then underwent repeat right breast diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on\n2/16/2024. Mammogram showed the butterfly clip. There is a 1.5 x 1.3 cm focal asymmetry in the\nposterior third of the lower outer quadrant of the right breast.

Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER-2 IHC studies are\nperformed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by immunohistochemistry, using antibody clone SP1 for\nER, 1E2 for PR and 4B5 for HER-2 IHC by an FDA-cleared vendor (Ventana). Detection is by a biotin-free,\nmultimer-based system. The intensity of staining is graded as weak, moderate or strong, and percent of\npositive tumor nuclei is estimated. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status are interpreted as positive (at\nleast weak staining in 1% of tumor nuclei) or negative (<1% of tumor nuclei). HER2 IHC is graded as negative\n(0 and 1+ staining), equivocal (2+ staining) and positive (3+ staining). This assay has not been validated on\ndecalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution given the likelihood of false negativity on\ndecalcified specimens.\nWolff, AC, Hammond ME, Hicks DG, et al.

Surgical options discussed were\nlumpectomy to be followed by adjuvant radiation or mastectomy, both to include sentinel lymph node\nmapping and biopsy and possible axillary lymph node dissection. We discussed the role of bilateral\nmastectomy and plastic surgery reconstruction.\nAfter considering her options, she is interested in bilateral simple mastectomy, right axillary sentinel lymph\nnode biopsy, possible right axillary lymph node dissection, and immediate reconstruction per plastic\nsurgery. Risks of surgery discussed include, but are not limited to, bleeding, infection, seroma,\nnumbness, scarring, injury to surrounding structures, need for additional procedures, poor cosmetic\noutcome, lymphedema, or cardiopulmonary risks of anesthesia.

She denies any breast symptoms at\nthe time including palpable masses, breast pain, nipple discharge, skin changes. She underwent\ndiagnostic imaging which revealed a hypoechoic mass approximately 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.7 cm at the 7 o'clock\nposition and a 1 cm benign-appearing cyst at the 9 o'clock position. Biopsy of the 7:00 mass was\nrecommended and completed which revealed benign breast tissue. Follow up imaging was completed in\n6 months and at that time the mass had increased in size, 1.4 x 0.7 x 1.2cm and biopsy was again\nrecommended, in addition a lymph node with mild cortical thickening was also recommended for biopsy.\nBiopsy of the breast mass at this time revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1, ER positive PR\npositive and HER2 negative.

Surgical options discussed were\nlumpectomy to be followed by adjuvant radiation or mastectomy, both to include sentinel lymph node\nmapping and biopsy and possible axillary lymph node dissection. We discussed the role of bilateral\nmastectomy and plastic surgery reconstruction.\nAfter considering her options, she is interested in bilateral simple mastectomy, right axillary sentinel lymph\nnode biopsy, possible right axillary lymph node dissection, and immediate reconstruction per plastic\nsurgery. Risks of surgery discussed include, but are not limited to, bleeding, infection, seroma,\nnumbness, scarring, injury to surrounding structures, need for additional procedures, poor cosmetic\noutcome, lymphedema, or cardiopulmonary risks of anesthesia.

The color-flow\ndynamics, maximum intensity projection and time intensity curves are reviewed. The\nimages were obtained using a dedicated breast coil on a 1.5 Tesla or greater magnet.\nFINDINGS:\nThere is mild background enhancement bilaterally.\nBREAST COMPOSITION:\nScattered fibroglandular tissue.\nRIGHT BREAST:\nIn the lower outer right breast at posterior depth there is an enhancing mass\nmeasuring 2 x 0.7 x 1.5 cm (image 84 of series 200 and image 223 of series 7).
