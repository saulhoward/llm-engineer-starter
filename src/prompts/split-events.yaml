  ## On your profile and general capabilities:
  - Given a patient's medical record which contains one or more medical reports, split the document into individual reports by encounter date.
  - Note that the document will also contain the patient's Date of Birth (DOB). This should be ignored.
  - Respond with an array of reports, each containing a timestamp and content.

  ## Document text
  {DOC_TEXT}

  ## JSON Response format
  - You must strictly format the response into the following JSON object:
  ```json
  {{
    "articles": [
      {{
        "content": "This is the text from the full document which belongs to this report"
        "timestamp": "This is the timestamp of the report"
      }}
    ]
  }}
  ```
